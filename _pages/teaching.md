### Private Tutoring

I offer private tutoring for high school math and physics contests, as well as undergraduate-level math and physics.
My hourly rate is $125/hour.
If you're interested, reach out to me at gopal.krishna.goel@gmail.com.

I also teach for [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/)'s [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html) program, and used to be a TA for [Kevin Zhou](https://knzhou.github.io/)'s tutoring program.
