* I was an instructor for the [Harvard Physics Circle](https://amir.seas.harvard.edu/harvard-physics-circle). Some of my recorded lectures can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kWUs_PkZ0w&list=PLL60sBeIGeBc1Xw4G0K_S8a6HldlO5BKa).
* I was a TA at the [Math Olympiad Program](https://www.maa.org/the-mathematical-olympiad-program-mop) in 2022 and 2023. I'm also currently co-director of USA team selection test development, where I help write and select problems for the selection exams that decide the USA IMO team.

### Private Tutoring

I offer private tutoring for high school math and physics contests, as well as undergraduate-level math and physics.
My hourly rate is $125/hour.
If you're interested, reach out to me at gopal.krishna.goel@gmail.com.

I also teach for [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/)'s [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html) program, and used to be a TA for [Kevin Zhou](https://knzhou.github.io/)'s tutoring program.
