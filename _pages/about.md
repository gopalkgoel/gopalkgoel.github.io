Hello, and welcome to my homepage! I am an undergraduate student at MIT studying mathematics and physics. I'm generally interested in combinatorics/probability/analysis and theoretical physics. Most of my past research has been in integrable probability and algebraic combinatorics, and I am currently working on projects in combinatorics, theoretical physics, and physics ML.

I was involved extensively with math and physics olympiads in high school, and I represented the USA at the [2018 IPhO](https://www.aapt.org/physicsteam/2018/team.cfm?id=1025) and at the [2020 IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=29882).

Feel free to reach out at gopalkg [at] mit [dot] edu.
