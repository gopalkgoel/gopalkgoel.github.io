Hello, and welcome to my homepage! I am an undergraduate student at MIT studying mathematics and physics. I'm generally interested in combinatorics/probability/analysis and theoretical physics. Most of my past research has been in integrable probability and algebraic combinatorics, and I am currently working on projects in combinatorics, theoretical physics, and physics ML.
