Hello! I am a student at MIT studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Biology. I am also an undergraduate researcher at the [Uhler Group @ Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.carolineuhler.com) and [Coley Group @ MIT Schwarzman College of Computing](https://coley.mit.edu/). Over the next few months, I'll be working on the protein engineering team at Microsoft Research (Winter 2023) and AI research team at Absci (Summer 2023). Previously, I worked as a Data Science R&D Intern in the Bioproducts Team at Eli Lilly and won grand awards at the Regeneron International Science Fair with my independent research projects.

Feel free to reach out at divnor80 [at] mit [dot] edu!

Currently
======

At the Coley Group and Broad Institute, I apply deep learning approaches for drug discovery with a focus on:

* Generative modeling for de novo drug design
* Deep learning for receptor-ligand binding prediction
* Kernel methods for cheminformatics applications

As an undergraduate student, I am involved with the biotechnology, computer science, and statistics ecosystems at MIT. Specifically, I:

* Serve as a research editor for the [MIT Undergraduate Research Journal](http://murj.mit.edu)
* Am a [NEET Living Machines Scholar](https://neet.mit.edu/threads/lm) where I work on collaborative synthetic biology projects as part of a 30 student cohort
* Design and deliver an interdiscplinary biotech education to MIT undergraduates as an associate of [MIT Biotech Group](https://biotech.mit.edu)

Skills
======

* **Machine Learning and Deep Learning:** PyTorch, TF-Keras, Jax, LightGBM, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, H2O, Numpy, Pandas
* **Bioinformatics/Cheminformatics:** RDKit, PyMOL, DeepChem, Biopython
* **General Software Development:** Python, Java, C++, Git, HTML/CSS, Android Studio, Firebase
